# Dotfiles Reimagination Project Plan

## Project Protocol

- **Goal**: Create a perfect development environment that allows machine rebuild at a moment's notice
- **Focus**: Reliability, automation, and easy ongoing updates
- **Approach**: Interview â†’ Plan â†’ Implement
- **Interview Style**: ONE question at a time, prefer yes/no or short answers
- **Artifact Usage**: Track progress, goals, and implementation plan across multiple chat sessions
- **Assistant Change Protocol**: The assistant will make changes directly without asking for permission. The user will request rollbacks if any changes are incorrect.
- **Documentation Check**: Always confirm Home Manager and Nix configuration changes against the official documentation before suggesting or applying them.

## Discovery Phase - Information Gathering

### Current Environment Assessment

- [x] Operating system(s) used: **PopOS (Ubuntu-based), has Nvidia GPU, open to other Linux distros**
- [x] Existing dotfiles status: **Has old repo (~5 years), out of date, many things broken, machine has evolved significantly**
- [x] Shell preferences: **zsh using oh-my-zsh**
- [x] Editor/IDE setup: **Migrating: WebStorm/PyCharm/DataGrip â†’ Cursor/PyCharm (free)/DbBeaver. Vim keybinds preferred, uses vim plugins. Remove DoomEmacs from dotfiles**
- [x] Current development stack: **Full stack startup IC/solo dev: Python, Node, React, Terraform, GitHub Actions + supporting frameworks for complete web app build/deploy pipeline**
- [x] Package managers used: **System: apt/snap/flatpak/brew (wants consolidation), JS: npm/pnpm, Python: poetry. Open to management tools for simplification**
- [x] Automation tools experience: **Terraform, Ansible (current dotfiles use Ansible but it's flaky). Open to better alternatives including VM-based approach if workflow isn't impacted**

### Requirements Analysis

- [x] Machine rebuild frequency/scenarios: **Regular: ~annually, Ad-hoc: new workplace/client (data safety), system corruption recovery. Currently avoided due to broken dotfiles**
- [x] Cross-platform needs: **Primary: main dev machine. Future: Docker image deployable to EC2/cloud instances**
- [x] Team/sharing requirements: **Public repo sharing, need secure secrets management**
- [x] Backup/sync preferences: **Git-based dotfiles repo with symlinks (currently hit-and-miss). WANTS: Better automation for OS changes â†’ dotfiles updates**
- [x] Update maintenance approach: **Priority: 1) Set-and-forget, 2) Monthly updates, 3) Daily tweaking (avoid as much as possible)**

### Technical Preferences

- [x] Configuration management approach: **Modular scripts organized by category (shell, editor, languages, etc.)**
- [x] Installation automation level: **CLI wizard (like Vorpal) with smart defaults for full environment, dependency tracking to prevent corrupted setups**
- [x] Customization vs simplicity balance: **Complete development environment - zero downtime after refresh (except script runtime)**
- [x] Version control strategy: **Manual commits (objective decision - avoids noise, maintains intentional change history)**

## Implementation Plan

### Technology Stack Decision

**Selected Approach**: **Nix + Home Manager + Just**

- **Nix/Home Manager**: Declarative, atomic rollbacks, handles all package management, maximum reliability
- **Just**: CLI wizard runner for modular installation
- **Rationale**: User prioritizes reliability over ease, comfortable with learning curve, single-machine use case

### Architecture Overview

**Unified Nix Configuration** - Everything managed through single declarative system:

- System packages & user environment via Home Manager
- Application configurations templated through Nix
- Shell setup (zsh + oh-my-zsh)
- Development tools (Cursor, PyCharm, DbBeaver)
- Language environments (Python/Poetry, Node/pnpm)
- Infrastructure tools (Terraform, cloud CLIs)
- All dotfiles and configs version controlled

### Module Structure (Function-Based)

- **shell.nix**: zsh, oh-my-zsh, terminal tools, prompt
- **editors.nix**: Cursor, PyCharm, DbBeaver, vim configs
- **languages.nix**: Python/Poetry, Node/pnpm, version managers
- **devops.nix**: Terraform, cloud CLIs, GitHub CLI, Docker
- **system.nix**: Base system packages, fonts, utilities
- **secrets.nix**: SSH keys, API tokens, encrypted configs

### CLI Wizard Design (Intelligent Granularity)

**Two-tier prompting system**:

1. **Module level**: "Setup shell environment? [Y/n]" (defaults to your standard config)
2. **Customization level**: "Customize shell setup? [y/N]" (only if they want to change defaults)

**Smart dependency handling**: Auto-enables required modules, shows what's being added
**Secrets management**: sops-nix for encrypted secrets in git, decrypted at build time

**Example flow**:

```
Setup shell environment? [Y/n] â†’ Y (installs your standard zsh+oh-my-zsh config)
Setup editors? [Y/n] â†’ Y
  Customize editor setup? [y/N] â†’ y
    Install Cursor? [Y/n] â†’ Y
    Install PyCharm? [Y/n] â†’ N (they only want Cursor this time)
    Install DbBeaver? [Y/n] â†’ Y
Setup languages? [Y/n] â†’ Y
  â†’ Auto-enabling shell (required for languages) âœ“
  â†’ Installing Python/Poetry, Node/pnpm with your defaults
```

**Result**: Fast default installs (6 Y's), full granularity when needed, smart dependency resolution

## Current Status

**Phase**: Implementation - In Progress ðŸš€
**Next**: Begin implementation with project structure and base Nix configuration

## Implementation Progress Notes

- 2025-06-01: Implementation phase started. Outstanding tasks checklist added. Ready to begin with repo structure and base Nix config.
- 2025-06-01: Existing Ansible playbooks and zsh configs identified. Will review and migrate relevant configs/scripts to new Nix modules as part of implementation.
- 2025-06-01: Nix/Home Manager directory structure and placeholder module files created. Ready to begin base Nix configuration.
- 2025-06-01: Modern flake.nix scaffolded with Home Manager integration and modular structure. Ready to bootstrap Home Manager and begin module implementation.
- 2025-06-01: Using nixos-unstable for latest features, but will revisit and switch to stable if all requirements are met with a stable channel. Prioritize stability if possible.
- 2025-06-01: Home Manager successfully bootstrapped using flake-based configuration. Legacy config warning is expected; always use --flake flag with home-manager commands. Assistant now makes changes without asking for permission, user will request rollbacks if needed.
- 2025-06-02: Migrated all zsh config (aliases, functions, completions, PATH, trash helpers, project jump, network info, reload, direnv, syntax highlighting, spicetify, etc.) to Home Manager. Legacy .zshrc and related files are now obsolete. asdf is installed via home.packages, not as a Home Manager program. Trash management and workflow helpers added. Spicetify path managed by Nix.
- 2025-06-02: Next focus: Translate ansible-playbook scripts to Nix modules for full migration.
- 2025-06-02: Add a plan to explore/implement a persistent file sync/backup solution (e.g., Google Drive, cloud sync) to automate keeping important files across system refreshes.

## Ready for Implementation

All discovery and planning complete. Architecture designed for:

- Zero-downtime rebuilds via Nix/Home Manager
- Intelligent CLI wizard with smart defaults
- Modular function-based organization
- Encrypted secrets management
- Consolidated package management

## Next Steps for Continuation

**Current Question Pending**: ~~Do you prefer a more minimalist approach with just the essentials, or do you want a feature-rich setup with lots of tools and customizations?~~

**Discovery Complete!** Ready to move to Implementation Planning phase.

**Remaining Discovery Items**: ~~All completed~~

**Ready for Implementation Planning**: Once technical preferences are complete, we can move to creating the detailed implementation plan.

## Goals Identified

- Machine rebuild capability at moment's notice
- Reliable and repeatable setup process
- Easy ongoing updates and maintenance
- Developer experience optimization

## Current Status

**Phase**: Discovery - Information Gathering
**Next**: Continue interviewing to understand current setup and requirements


## Recent Progress

- **2025-06-01:** Implemented a Home Manager activation script in `editors.nix` to automatically fix permissions for the Cursor config directory. This ensures Cursor/VSCode can always write to its settings files, eliminating EACCES errors.

## Next Steps (Reminder)

- **Next:** Migrate zsh settings from legacy dotfiles to the new Home Manager environment. Review old zsh configs, extract relevant customizations, and declaratively integrate them into the Nix-based setup.
